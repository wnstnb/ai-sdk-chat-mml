# Chat UX Issues - Post Task 16

This document tracks user experience issues discovered after completing task 16.

## MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Resolved Issues

### üéØ **Issue 2: DocumentId Error on Hard Refresh with Tool Call Messages** ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Multiple critical problems after hard refresh causing AI to be completely unresponsive
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

#### **Problem #1: Editor Context Injection Order** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Editor context was being injected BEFORE user messages, causing AI to respond to context instead of user's actual message
- **Symptoms**: AI would always say "Thanks for sharing your current document structure..." and ignore user requests
- **Fix**: Changed editor context injection from BEFORE to AFTER user messages in API route
- **File**: `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 1220+
- **Code Change**: `finalMessagesForStreamText.push(editorContextCoreMessage);` instead of `splice(lastUserMessageIdx, 0, ...)`

#### **Problem #2: Follow-Up Context Auto-Population** ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
- **Root Cause**: AI responses were automatically being added to follow-up context instead of manual user selection
- **Symptoms**: Every AI response appeared in "Follow-up Context" section incorrectly
- **Fix**: Removed automatic `setFollowUpContext(message.content)` from `onFinish` callback
- **File**: `lib/hooks/editor/useChatInteractions.ts`
- **Additional Fix**: Added proper follow-up context integration to `sendMessage` function so manually added context is actually sent to AI

#### **Problem #3: Server-Side Tool State Corruption** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Frontend was incorrectly trying to process server-side tools (`webSearch`, `searchAndTagDocumentsTool`) causing state corruption when interrupted
- **Symptoms**: After websearch interruption + hard refresh, AI would be completely unresponsive  
- **Fix**: Added proper tool architecture separation in frontend processing
- **File**: `app/editor/[documentId]/page.tsx`
- **Code Change**: Filter out server-side tools from client-side processing loop, mark them as processed without execution

#### **Problem #4: DocumentId Guard Issues** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: DocumentId validation was blocking legitimate requests after hard refresh
- **Symptoms**: Messages wouldn't send at all, no API calls in network logs
- **Fix**: Re-enabled documentId guard with console.warn instead of toast errors to avoid user annoyance
- **File**: `lib/hooks/editor/useChatInteractions.ts`

#### **Problem #5: Toast Spam on Page Load** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Error toasts showing on normal page initialization when editor context not immediately available
- **Symptoms**: "Editor Context Not Available" and "Chat error: documentId undefined" toasts on every page load
- **Fix**: Changed error toasts to console.warn for initialization errors
- **File**: `lib/hooks/editor/useChatInteractions.ts`

#### **Problem #6: Editor Context Not Being Sent** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Frontend was sending `editorContext` but API expected `editorBlocksContext`
- **Symptoms**: AI couldn't see document content at all
- **Fix**: Changed data structure to send `editorBlocksContext: editorContext.editorBlocksContext`
- **File**: `lib/hooks/editor/useChatInteractions.ts` line 653-662

### üéØ **Issue 7: Tool Call Duplication on Page Refresh** ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Client-side tool calls (addContent, modifyContent, etc.) being executed twice - once during initial chat and again on page refresh
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED**

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Problem**: Client-side tools in `combinedToolsWithRateLimit` had no `execute` functions
- **Consequence**: AI SDK created incomplete tool calls (tool-call parts without tool-result parts) 
- **Database Persistence**: Incomplete tool calls were saved to database in assistant messages
- **Page Refresh Issue**: React component detected incomplete tool calls and re-executed them

#### **Symptoms**
- Duplicate content appearing in editor after hard refresh
- Only occurred when last assistant message contained tool calls
- Content would keep multiplying with each refresh
- No `[addContent] EXECUTION STARTED` logs showing during duplicated execution

#### **Architectural Fix**
- **Solution**: Added synthetic `execute` functions to all client-side tools
- **Purpose**: Complete tool calls server-side to prevent incomplete state persistence
- **Result Structure**: Returns `{ type: 'client-side-tool-call', toolName: '...', completed: true }`
- **Architecture Preserved**: Client-side tools still execute on frontend, but now have proper completion state

#### **Files Modified**
- **File**: `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- **Changes**: Added synthetic execute functions to `clientSideTools`: `addContent`, `modifyContent`, `deleteContent`, `modifyTable`, `createChecklist`
- **Logging**: Added `[ServerSide-ClientTool]` logs to track synthetic execution

#### **Verification**
- Tool calls now properly complete server-side with synthetic results
- No incomplete tool calls persist in database
- Page refresh no longer triggers duplicate executions
- Client-side execution still works as intended

### **üí° Key Architectural Discoveries**

#### **Tool Architecture Clarification**
- **Client-Side Tools**: `addContent`, `modifyContent`, `deleteContent`, `modifyTable`, `createChecklist`
  - No `execute` function in API definition
  - Processed by frontend tool loop in `EditorPage.tsx`  
  - Must call `addToolResult()` to complete execution
  
- **Server-Side Tools**: `webSearch`, `searchAndTagDocumentsTool`
  - Have `execute` functions that run on backend
  - Results automatically streamed to frontend
  - Should NOT be processed by frontend tool loop
  - Results rendered by `ChatMessageItem.tsx`

#### **Message Flow Architecture**
- **Correct Order**: System Message ‚Üí Previous History ‚Üí User Message ‚Üí [Editor Context] 
- **Previous Broken Order**: System Message ‚Üí Previous History ‚Üí [Editor Context] ‚Üí User Message

### üéØ **Issue 4: Follow-Up Context Integration** ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
- **Problem #1**: AI responses auto-added to follow-up context ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Problem #2**: Manually added follow-up context not sent to AI ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **Implementation**: 
  - Follow-up context now properly appended to user messages before sending
  - Format: `Follow-up Context: {context}\n\n---\n\n{user_message}`
  - Automatically cleared after sending message
- **File**: `lib/hooks/editor/useChatInteractions.ts`

## Active Issues

### 1. Audio Transcription Not Working in Editor
- **Issue**: Transcribed text not making it through after pressing record in the chat input while in the editor/viewing a document
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **Context**: Audio recording appears to work (waveform shows), but transcription doesn't complete and auto-submit doesn't trigger
- **Expected Behavior**: After recording, audio should transcribe and automatically submit the message
- **Actual Behavior**: Recording starts and stops, but no transcription or submission occurs

### 3. AI Cannot See Document Content + Infinite Re-renders ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED** - Was part of the major breakthrough above
- **Root Causes**: Multiple issues including editor context injection order, data structure mismatch, and tool processing problems
- **All Symptoms Resolved**: Infinite re-renders stopped, AI can see document content, tool calls work properly

## Investigation Notes

### Audio Transcription Issue
- Recording functionality works (audio visualization appears)
- May be related to orchestrator transcription flow
- Could be auto-submission logic not triggering
- Need to check browser console logs during recording

## Resolved Issues Archive

### DocumentId Error - LEGACY ISSUE ‚ùå **SUPERSEDED**
- **Note**: This was actually multiple distinct issues that have been individually resolved above
- **Legacy Root Cause**: AI SDK's `convertToCoreMessages` function expected all tool calls to have results
- **Legacy Solution**: Added cleanup logic in `/api/chat/route.ts` that filters out incomplete tool calls
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ **All underlying issues identified and fixed individually**

      "taskTitle": "Diagnose ImagePart creation issue in database save logic",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the diagnosis process into subtasks such as: (1) Add detailed logging to message saving logic, (2) Trace incoming message structure and uploaded image path, (3) Analyze contentForDb construction, (4) Create and run a test case for image upload, (5) Compare actual vs expected database content.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep investigation into backend logic, careful tracing of data flow, and hands-on testing. It involves multiple code paths and debugging steps, making it moderately complex and best split into several focused subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Fix ImagePart creation for database save",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: (1) Refactor message saving logic to ensure ImagePart creation, (2) Implement checks for uploadedImagePath, (3) Test with various message types (text, image, both), (4) Validate database content after changes.",
      "reasoning": "This is a targeted backend refactor with clear requirements, but it touches critical message construction logic and must handle several edge cases, warranting multiple subtasks for safe implementation and validation."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Add logging to signed URL generation, (2) Trace fetch and base64 conversion, (3) Validate message structure for AI, (4) Test with different image types, (5) Confirm AI response references image.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend tracing and integration with external AI services, requiring careful validation of data formats and error handling, making it moderately complex and suitable for multiple subtasks."

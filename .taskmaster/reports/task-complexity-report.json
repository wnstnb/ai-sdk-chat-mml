      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into distinct technical and UX components, including component creation, database and API updates, hierarchy management, UI/UX features, accessibility, performance optimization, and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical domains (frontend, backend, database, UX, accessibility, performance, edge cases) and requires careful coordination between them. The detailed description already outlines 12 major subtasks, each addressing a critical aspect of the feature. The high complexity is due to the need for recursive rendering, state management, drag-and-drop, accessibility, and performance optimizations, all of which are non-trivial and require thorough testing and integration[4][5]."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for i18n library setup, string extraction, translation integration, locale formatting, and RTL support preparation.",
      "reasoning": "i18n is a well-understood process with clear steps, but it touches many parts of the UI and requires careful string management."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Folder Support in Card-Based View",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 12,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into distinct technical and UX components, including component creation, database and API updates, hierarchy management, UI/UX features, accessibility, performance optimization, and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical domains (frontend, backend, database, UX, accessibility, performance, edge cases) and requires careful coordination between them. The detailed description already outlines 12 major subtasks, each addressing a critical aspect of the feature. The high complexity is due to the need for recursive rendering, state management, drag-and-drop, accessibility, and performance optimizations, all of which are non-trivial and require thorough testing and integration[4][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Star/Favorite Toggle Functionality for Document Cards",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the star/favorite toggle for document cards into subtasks covering UI component integration, state management, API communication, optimistic updates, error handling, offline support, accessibility, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple layers of complexity: UI/UX design, real-time state management, backend API integration, optimistic UI updates, error handling, offline queuing, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, and manual). The need to handle asynchronous operations, maintain responsive feedback, and ensure accessibility and offline support increases both cyclomatic and structural complexity. Given these factors, the task is moderately complex and should be split into at least 8 subtasks to ensure clarity and maintainability."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on adapting an existing UI component to work with the audio recording functionality. It requires understanding the current implementation, modifying the props interface, and ensuring proper connection between the hook's state and the UI elements. The complexity is moderate as it involves working with existing code rather than creating new functionality from scratch.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the adaptation of ChatInputUI for audio recording into subtasks covering: props interface extension, UI element modifications for recording states, connection with the useAudioRecorder hook's state and handlers, and accessibility improvements for audio recording states."

      "reasoning": "Testing and debugging audio functionality is complex due to the variety of environments, browser implementations, and potential permission issues. This task requires comprehensive testing across different browsers, microphone configurations, and user scenarios. It also involves comparing behavior with the original implementation and fixing any discrepancies.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the testing and debugging process into subtasks covering: cross-browser compatibility testing, permission handling verification, transcription accuracy testing, error state handling, performance optimization, and accessibility validation. Include specific test cases and debugging strategies for each area."

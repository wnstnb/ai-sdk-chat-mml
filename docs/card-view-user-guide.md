# User Guide: Card-Based File Browser

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the new card-based file browser! This guide will help you understand its features and how to use them to manage your documents and folders more effectively. The new interface provides a visual and intuitive way to interact with your files.

## 2. Getting Started

The card-based file browser is designed to be your primary way of interacting with files. 

*   **Accessing the View:** In most cases, this view will be the default when you navigate to the file management area of the application. If there are options to switch between different views (e.g., list view vs. card view), look for a view toggle icon (often resembling grid lines or a list) usually located near the top of the file browsing area or within a settings menu.

## 3. Understanding the Interface

When you open the file browser, you'll see a few key areas:

*   **Document Cards:** Each of your documents is represented by a card, showing its name, a preview or snippet, and when it was last updated.
*   **Folder Cards:** Folders are also shown as cards, displaying the folder name and potentially a preview of its contents.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Usually located at the top, these show your current path in the folder hierarchy (e.g., "My Files > Projects > Q1 Report") and allow you to navigate back to parent folders.
*   **Search Bar:** Helps you quickly find documents by typing keywords.
*   **Controls:** Buttons or icons for actions like creating new folders, sorting items, etc. (Details will vary based on final implementation).

## 4. Core Features & How-To

This section explains how to use the main features of the card-based file browser.

### 4.1. Viewing Documents and Folders

*   Simply browse the grid of cards to see your documents and folders.
*   Document cards may show additional information like a star icon if you've marked it as a favorite.

### 4.2. Navigating Folders

*   **Entering a Folder:** Click on a folder card to open it and view its contents.
*   **Going Back (Parent Folder):** Use the breadcrumbs at the top to click on a parent folder's name, or look for a "back" button if available.

### 4.3. Searching for Documents

*   Locate the search bar (usually at the top).
*   Type in keywords related to the document's title or content.
*   The view will update to show matching documents.
*   To clear search results and return to the folder view, clear the search bar or click an "X" icon if present.

### 4.4. Organizing with Folders

Folders help you keep your documents tidy and easy to find.

*   **Creating a New Folder:**
    *   Look for a "New Folder" button or icon, often located near the top of the file browser or alongside the breadcrumbs.
    *   Click it, and you'll likely be prompted to enter a name for your new folder.
    *   Once created, the new folder will appear in your current view.
*   **Renaming a Folder:**
    *   To rename a folder, you might need to find an options menu (often a "..." or gear icon) on the folder card, then select "Rename".
    *   Alternatively, some interfaces allow you to click on the folder's name directly to edit it.
    *   Type the new name and confirm (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a save button).
*   **Deleting a Folder:**
    *   Similar to renaming, find the options menu on the folder card and select "Delete".
    *   You'll likely be asked to confirm before the folder is permanently removed. Be careful, as deleting a folder might also delete its contents or move them to a different location depending on the system's design.

### 4.5. Starring/Favoriting Documents

*   Look for a star icon on document cards.
*   Click the star icon to toggle its "favorite" status.
*   Starred documents might be easier to find (e.g., through a "Starred" filter or sort option, if available).

### 4.6. Moving Documents and Folders (Drag and Drop)

*   **To Move an Item:** Click and hold on a document or folder card, then drag it.
*   **Dropping into a Folder:** Drag the item over the target folder card. The folder card should highlight to indicate it's a valid drop target. Release the mouse button to move the item into that folder.
*   **Dropping into a Parent Folder (via Breadcrumbs):** You might also be able to drag an item onto a folder name in the breadcrumbs to move it there.

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

*   **Use Folders Wisely:** Create a folder structure that makes sense to you. Don't create too many nested folders if it makes navigation cumbersome.
*   **Name Clearly:** Give your documents and folders descriptive names so you can easily identify them later.
*   **Leverage Search:** If you can't remember where a document is, use the search bar. Try different keywords if your first search doesn't find it.
*   **Star Your Important Files:** Mark frequently accessed or important documents as favorites using the star icon for quick access (if a "Starred" filter or view is available).
*   **Regularly Tidy Up:** Periodically review your files and folders. Delete what you no longer need and reorganize if your current structure isn't working well.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I rename a file or folder?**
    *   A: For folders, look for an options menu (often "...") on the folder card and select "Rename". For documents, this action might be available on the document card or you might need to open the document to rename it (depending on the application's design).
*   **Q: Can I select multiple items at once?**
    *   A: This guide primarily covers single-item operations. If multi-select functionality is available, it typically works by: 
        *   Holding down `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (Mac) while clicking multiple cards.
        *   Clicking checkboxes that appear on cards when you hover over them or when in a "select mode".
        *   Dragging a selection box around multiple items (click and drag on an empty area).
    *   Once multiple items are selected, actions like "Move" or "Delete" would apply to all selected items. This section will be updated with specific instructions if this feature is implemented.
*   **Q: How do I see more details about a document without opening it?**
    *   A: Hovering over a document card might show a tooltip with more information, or there might be an "info" icon on the card. Some details like last updated date are usually visible directly on the card.
*   **Q: What happens when I delete a folder? Are the documents inside also deleted?**
    *   A: Typically, when you delete a folder, the documents and any subfolders within it are also moved to a trash or archive area, or they might be permanently deleted. Always check for a confirmation message that explains what will happen before you delete a folder.
*   **Q: How do I get back to the main or "root" folder view?**
    *   A: Use the breadcrumbs. Clicking the first item in the breadcrumb trail (often named "My Files", "All Files", or "Root") will take you to the top level.

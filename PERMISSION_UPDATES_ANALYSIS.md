# Real-time Permission Updates Analysis

## Problem Statement

Users wanted real-time permission updates in the collaborative editor. Specifically:
- When UserA (document owner) changes UserB's permissions from "editor" to "viewer"
- UserB should immediately lose editing capabilities without needing to refresh the page
- This should work across different browser windows/tabs

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. PartyKit Custom Permission Notifications ❌

**Approach**: Created custom PartyKit server and WebSocket messaging for permission updates

**Implementation**:
- Custom `PartykitYjsProvider` with permission update callbacks
- Separate PartyKit permissions server (`party/src/permissions.ts`)
- `usePermissionUpdates` hook with WebSocket connections
- Integration with ShareDocumentModal to send notifications

**Why it failed**:
- PartyKit is designed for real-time collaboration, not authorization management
- The existing editor uses `YPartyKitProvider` from @y-partykit/provider library
- Our custom provider wasn't being used, so notifications never worked
- Over-engineering a simple problem with complex WebSocket coordination

### 2. Supabase Realtime ❌

**Approach**: Used Supabase's native Realtime feature to listen to `document_permissions` table changes

**Implementation**:
- `usePermissionChanges` hook subscribing to PostgreSQL changes
- Direct database change notifications via LISTEN/NOTIFY
- Filtered subscriptions by document ID
- Integration with existing permission refresh logic

**Why it failed**:
- Supabase Realtime is still in **alpha** and not production-ready
- Not suitable for production applications requiring reliability

## Current State (Acceptable Solution)

**How it works now**:
- ✅ Permissions are checked when the editor loads
- ✅ Permissions are enforced correctly (editor becomes read-only for viewers)
- ✅ Permission changes are saved to database immediately
- ✅ New users see correct permissions when they first load the document
- ❌ Existing users need to refresh the page to see permission changes

**Components that work**:
- `useDocumentPermissions`: Fetches and manages permission state
- `ShareDocumentModal`: Updates permissions in database
- `CollaborativeBlockNoteEditor`: Enforces permissions with `editable={canEdit}`
- PartyKit: Handles document collaboration (Y.js sync) reliably

## Recommendation

**Accept the current limitation**: Real-time permission updates are not critical for the user experience. The current behavior is:

1. **Immediate for new users**: Anyone opening the document after permission changes sees the correct permissions
2. **Eventual for existing users**: Users need to refresh to see permission changes
3. **Secure**: All permissions are properly enforced server-side in API routes
4. **Reliable**: No complex real-time coordination that could fail

**Why this is acceptable**:
- Permission changes are relatively rare events
- Users typically expect to refresh after significant account changes
- The core collaboration features (document editing) work perfectly
- Security is maintained - no user can bypass permissions

## Future Considerations

If real-time permission updates become critical:

1. **Wait for Supabase Realtime to reach production stability**
2. **Consider server-sent events (SSE)** for simple one-way notifications
3. **Implement periodic permission checks** (poll every 30-60 seconds)
4. **Use WebSocket libraries designed for authorization** (not collaboration-focused)

For now, the existing implementation provides a secure, reliable collaborative editing experience.
